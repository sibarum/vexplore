/**
 * A least-recently-used cache bounded by weight rather than by count, which is the bound that matters when one entry
 * is a 32x32 icon and the next is a photograph.
 *
 * <p>LRU because browsing goes back to what it saw recently: arrowing down a folder and up again should find the last
 * few pictures waiting. The entry just added is never the one evicted, even when it alone is over budget, so a single
 * large image is still shown rather than refused; it simply leaves nothing else room to stay.
 *
 * <p>{@code evicted} is told about each value as it leaves, under the cache's lock, so a cache of GPU textures can
 * hand each one back. Thread-safe, though a cache used from one thread pays nothing for it.
