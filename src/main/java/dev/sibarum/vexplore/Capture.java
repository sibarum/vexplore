 *
 * <h2>The real tree, through the real wiring</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code VexelApplication.tree} runs {@code CONFIG} through {@code TREE} and stops — no window, no input
 * backend and no window memory, so nothing reached from here can write a placement. <b>Build the tree by a
 * second route and this stops being a picture of this application:</b> a hand-assembled {@code Gui} misses
 * whatever the wiring says and the framework applies, starting with the theme and the zoom range, and it
 * misses it silently. The picture still looks plausible, which is what makes it worth avoiding rather than
 * worth debugging.
 *
 * <p>So a scene here is a lambda over a {@link Shell}, and the caller owns the shutdown because {@code tree}
 * hands one back rather than closing it. Add scenes by adding cases to {@link #run} — a named panel open, the
 * tree at exactly the minimum size, a ladder of zoom levels — and each one gets the same tree a user gets.
 *
 * <h2>What a capture can and cannot show</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link GuiApp#capture} is {@code static} and builds its <b>own</b> Vulkan instance and device for the
 * occasion. Anything in the tree whose content comes from <em>this application's</em> device — a render
 * target, a storage buffer, a marched scene — is not on that device, and draws as the framework's placeholder
 * texture instead.
 *
 * <p>It does not fail. It produces a picture that is <b>correct about the chrome and silently wrong about the
 * content</b>, which is the failure mode worth naming here rather than discovering during a review. When this
 * application grows content of that kind, photograph it through the automation socket's {@code shot} against a
 * running window, and say so in the file name.
 *
 * <h2>Two frames, not one</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code GuiApp.capture} already renders twice and it is worth knowing why, because anything derived from a
 * measured box has the same shape: the observer that reacts to a layout fires <em>inside</em> that layout, and
 * the mutation it posts is applied by the next drain. A still image wants the settled state rather than the
 * instant before it.
