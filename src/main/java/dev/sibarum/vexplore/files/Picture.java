/**
 * A decoded image, made ready to upload: every frame packed into one RGBA8 sheet, scaled down to what the dock can
 * show.
 *
 * <p><b>One sheet, however many frames.</b> A texture is uploaded once and never rewritten, so an animation is shown
 * as one texture and a moving rectangle of it ({@code ImageRegion.cell(i, columns, rows)}), and a still is the sheet
 * of one. The packing happens here, off the GUI thread, so the GUI thread's part is a single upload.
 *
 * <p><b>Scaled down, never up.</b> A 6000 px photograph is 144 MB of RGBA and the dock shows a few hundred pixels of
 * it, and a texture larger than the device allows does not upload at all. So each frame is box-filtered to at most
 * {@link #FRAME_SIDE} on its long side, and an animation further until its sheet fits in {@link #SHEET_SIDE}.
 *
 * <p>Pixels are straight (non-premultiplied) RGBA8, top row first, as imagelib gives them and as the GUI uploads them.
 * The arrays are live: do not write to them.
 *
 * @param stamp        the version of the file this was decoded from: the cache key
 * @param sheet        {@code sheetWidth * sheetHeight * 4} bytes
 * @param frameWidth   one cell's width in px
 * @param frameHeight  one cell's height in px
 * @param columns      cells across the sheet
 * @param rows         cells down the sheet
 * @param delays       each frame's display time in ms, 0 where the file gave none; the length is the frame count
 * @param sourceWidth  the size the file says it is: for display, and for saying so in the header
 * @param sourceHeight the same, down
 * @param vector       whether this was rasterised from a document with no pixel size of its own
